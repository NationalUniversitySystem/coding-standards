This makes the codebase easier to maintain; it speeds up site load times and deployment times; priorities change frequently; and over time, various teams and team members touch different parts of the codebase. We strive to help stakeholders identify goals rather than specific methods to reach their goals, reflect on the best way to achieve those goals, and achieve the shared vision with a minimum viable product. To help keep things simple, follow these guidelines: . | Follow WordPress coding standards, particularly WPVIP standards. | Do things the “WordPress way,” meaning generally include functionality in plugins, styling in themes, and WP functions where feasible. | Use native components (basic HTML elements with built-in functionality) where possible. (For example, use the &lt;nav&gt; element for navigation.) | Use the least amount of markup possible. (For example, avoid nesting &lt;div&gt;s repeatedly.) | Make use of the cascade in CSS. (For example, set the main font on the &lt;body&gt; tag so it only needs to be overriden for heading tags. As another example, favor lower specificity selectors like .group rather than high-specificity selectors like #chat-box or .group .content.black a.highlight.) | Extend Core blocks rather than building wholly separate blocks where feasible. | Remove code rather than commenting it out. | Develop mobile-first. This is a shift from how the teams built in the past, but over time as we move to this paradigm it speeds up page loads for mobile screens significantly. | . ",
