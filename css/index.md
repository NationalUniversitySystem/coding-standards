# CSS

## Simple

Much of our codebase was built with dependencies such as Bootstrap. Though that was beneficial at the time, CSS has evolved by leaps and bounds, and we prefer to avoid such dependencies where possible. Prefer straight CSS over frameworks, and when touching old code, try to update it to no longer require Bootstrap so that eventually we can shed the dependency.

## Responsive

## Media queries

All media queries should be min-width, not max-width.
